## Getting Started
Before using these code snippets, make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download and install it from the official Python website. You will also need to install any necessary libraries by running pip install -r requirements.txt. We recommend creating a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other Python projects.

To use these code snippets, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/your_username/python-code-snippets.git

## Included Scripts
This repository contains the following Python code snippets:

**web_crawler.py:** A simple web crawler that can be used to scrape data from websites.

**api_json_sqlite.py:** A script that demonstrates how to interact with a REST API to fetch data in JSON format and store it in a SQLite database.

**json_to_sqlite.py:** A script that shows how to read data from a JSON file and insert it into a SQLite database.

**parse_html.py:** A script that uses the BeautifulSoup library to parse HTML data and extract specific elements.

**parse_json.py:** A script that demonstrates how to parse JSON data and extract specific information.

**parse_xml.py:** A script that shows how to parse XML data and extract specific elements using the ElementTree library.

**xml_to_sqlite.py:** A script that reads data from an XML file and inserts it into a SQLite database.

## Usage
Each script can be run independently by executing it in a Python environment. Before running a script, make sure to install any necessary libraries by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
